We'll follow a step-by-step process to train our model:\n","\n","1. Download and explore the data\n","2. Prepare the dataset for training\n","3. Train a linear regression model\n","4. Make predictions and evaluate the model\n","\n","As you go through this notebook, you will find a **???** in certain places. Your job is to replace the **???** with appropriate code or values, to ensure that the notebook runs properly end-to-end and your machine learning model is trained properly without errors. \n","\n","**Guidelines**\n","\n","1. Make sure to run all the code cells in order. Otherwise, you may get errors like `NameError` for undefined variables.\n","2. Do not change variable names, delete cells, or disturb other existing code. It may cause problems during evaluation.\n","3. In some cases, you may need to add some code cells or new statements before or after the line of code containing the **???**. \n","4. Since you'll be using a temporary online service for code execution, save your work by running `jovian.commit` at regular intervals.\n","5. Review the \"Evaluation Criteria\" for the assignment carefully and make sure your submission meets all the criteria.\n","6. Questions marked **(Optional)** will not be considered for evaluation and can be skipped. They are for your learning.\n","7. It's okay to ask for help & discuss ideas on the [community forum](https://jovian.ai/forum/c/zero-to-gbms/gbms-assignment-1/100), but please don't post full working code, to give everyone an opportunity to solve the assignment on their own.\n","\n","\n","**Important Links**:\n","\n","- Make a submission here: https://jovian.ai/learn/machine-learning-with-python-zero-to-gbms/assignment/assignment-1-train-your-first-ml-model\n","- Ask questions, discuss ideas and get help here: https://jovian.ai/forum/c/zero-to-gbms/gbms-assignment-1/100\n","- Review the following notebooks:\n","    - https://jovian.ai/aakashns/python-sklearn-linear-regression\n","    - https://jovian.ai/aakashns/python-sklearn-logistic-regression\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"modern-preparation","metadata":{},"source":["## How to Run the Code and Save Your Work\n","\n","\n","**Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended):** The easiest way to start executing the code is to click the **Run** button at the top of this page and select **Run on Binder**.
